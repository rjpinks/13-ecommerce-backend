1 ISSUE: setting up a .env with my password n whatnot to connect to the db

2 ISSUE: when schema and seed commands are ran, they set up a db

3 ISSUE: when the program is ran then sequelize models are synced to the db. It also starts the server (obviously lol)

4 ISSUE: while using postman, the get routes display the appropriate JSON data.

5 ISSUE: POST, PUT AND DELETE routes also work in their appropriate ways.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

The first animation shows the routes working in the video (shown in postman). 

The second animation shows single products being read by GET routes.

The final animation shows the POST, PUT, and DELETE routes working.

Right now I need to be doing some stuff inn the index.js in the models i'm pretty sure.

After I get the models working maybe look into the seeds to see that they're looking good.

Next, I'll need to go into the routes and make sure all the routes are working.

I think those are the main things, but it ain't gonna be that easy lbvs.
