1 ISSUE: setting up a .env with my password n whatnot to connect to the db

2 ISSUE: when schema and seed commands are ran, they set up a db

3 ISSUE: when the program is ran then sequelize models are synced to the db. It also starts the server (obviously lol)

4 ISSUE: while using postman, the get routes display the appropriate JSON data.

5 ISSUE: POST, PUT AND DELETE routes also work in their appropriate ways.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

The first animation shows the routes working in the video (shown in postman). 

The second animation shows single products being read by GET routes.

The final animation shows the POST, PUT, and DELETE routes working.

Okay, the database is seeded, and working. Unfortunately, the foriegn key stuff is not working properly.
    -Fix this issue, and it's all kosher.
    -Nevermind, they're working, but it's just one with a product_id that doesn't match. It doesn't really make sense it to have it at all though tbh.

I still have to go into the routes, and make sure user interaction works. This is what I'll need postman for.
